# Selection Sort

## Implementation
In selection sort, we divide the array into two parts; a sorted left part and an unsorted right part. We will repeadtedly **select** the minimum element from the unsorted right part and put it in the end of the sorted left right, starting from index 0.
## Time Complexity

For any input, the selection sort algorithm will perform the same operations, so the Best, Average, and Worse Case Time Complexity will all be O(n<sup>2</sup>).

## Worst Case Space Complexity O(1)
The sorting algorithm is done in-place
